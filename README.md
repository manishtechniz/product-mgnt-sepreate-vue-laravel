# Product Management

This project built with seperate laravel backend and vue js frontend. In this, I have created useable and scalable vue js components like as: `VFlashGroup`, `VFlashGroupItem`, `Modal`, `VButton`, `Vconfirm`, `VDatagrid` and `VLabel`

Basically, It based on `Product Management with Category`.

> NOTE: I used starter template for this project :)
